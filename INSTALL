Installation Instructions
*************************

   This is a pre-release (aka snapshot of the subversion repos). Expect
the program to destroy all your data.

   If that doesn't scare you, lets see what is needed to build the 
digitalSTROM Server (dSS).

Prerequisites
=============

   The following libraries and their respective headers and development
libraries have to be present on your system:

   * libxml
   * boost
   * poco
   * gsoap
   * libical
   * spidermonkey
   * dns_sd or avahi

Installation
============

   After you've installed these libraries issue the following command to
build your system:

   (cd build; cmake .. && make)

   This should generate the "dss" executable.

      Specifie the default location of the data directory.

   -DWITH_TESTS=[yes|no] 
      Include tests in the build.

   -DWITH_SIM=[yes|no] 
      Include the simulation in the build

   -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=[Release|Debug]

Running & Using
