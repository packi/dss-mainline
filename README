digitalSTROM Server - dSS

   This is a pre-release (aka snapshot of the subversion repos). Expect
the program to destroy all your data.

Building
========

   See the INSTALL document for information on how to build the dSS.

Running
=======

   Assuming you are in the build directory after building the dSS you can
run it using

   (cd ..; build/dss)

Using
=====

   After starting the dSS it will open up a webserver at port 8080. So if
you point your webserver to:

   http://localhost:8080/

you'll be greeted by a enumeration of the devices currently connected.

   Everything is served out of dss/data/webroot. There is a JavaScript API
located in webroot/js/model.js. The code in there should be enough 
"documentation" for an interested developer.
