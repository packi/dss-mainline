This is the setup interface for the digitalSTROM server.

It is written in JavaScript and is based on the extjs JavaScript
library, see http://www.extjs.com/

Use "sprockets" to build it (see http://getsprockets.org/).

$ sprocketize -I ./ dss-setup-interface.js > out.js

and then copy out.js to where you want.
