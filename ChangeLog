dSS - digitalSTROM Server

v1.6.0 13.02.2012
	* keep unit Wh for energyMeterValue in property tree, fixes #1355
	* set the maximal allowed power value for metering
	* introduce button clicks as system events, implements #1313
	* set solar times properties to empty when they do not occur today
	* also calculate civil, nautical and astronomical twilights

v1.5.1 06.02.2012
    * better RRD detection on startup, avoids generation of new rrd file
      on each startup
    * correctly handle optional getValues() parameters
    * store power series in RRD, use power series only for seconds intervall

v1.5.0 31.01.2012
    * added js scripting interface to libcurl (#1279)
      added scripting module with a http prototype object
    * metering series do not store power values
    * add possibility to select the desired range of metering values (#1330)
    * change metering intervals (#1332)
    * reinstate "energy" series as energy counter values (#1318)
    * new series "energyDelta" with energy per resolution step. Optional in
      "Ws" or "Wh" (default)
    * keep energy counter always increasing
    * added scripting Zone.callScene method (#842)
    * use tr1/unordered_map instead of the GCC ext/hash_map (#1290)
    * filter getReachableScenes by group (#1310)

v1.4.2 18.01.2012
	* ds485 state handling and possible dSS crash:
	  fix wrong callback registration

v1.4.1 16.01.2012
	* get rid of dSM API deprecated wranings, fixes #1269
	* correctly set present flag for zones and groups, fixes #1302
	* made system log level configurable, implements #1312
	* ignore metering callbacks that indicate an error (prevents treating
	  random data as valid metetring values)
	* changed js Metering.getValues() to return double instead of
	  int values, fixes #1317
	* reenable bonjour support (got broken in the last release)
	* flush dirty datamodel after initialization is complete, fixes #1270
	* fixed solar computer warnings
	* further improvements and fixes in the new build system

v1.4.0 05.01.2012
	* read and save energy values in Ws instead of Wh from the dSM
	* added unit parameter to JSON and SOAP API to request metering data in Ws
	  or Wh
	* reworked dSM readout, now using dSM hash again to optimize readout
	* free user object in authentication methods
	* added autoools support
